# how to do an anova in R

# uses the base function aov()
# which takes form:
aov(NumericVariableName ~ Treatment, data = NameOfDataFrame)

# example; checking if differences in number of bacteria resulting from diff UV 
# exposure times are significant. 

# 1 create (or import) data
# here we'll make some fake data
NumberBacteria = c(987,988,799,233,121,141,878,231,411)  # variable of no of bacteria
Treatment = c("No_UV",	"No_UV",	"No_UV", "UV_5mins",	"UV_5mins",	"UV_5mins",	"UV_1min",	"UV_1min",	"UV_1min") # & associated tmt
MyDataFrame = data.frame(NumberBacteria,Treatment) # make these as two columns of data in MyDataFrame
head(MyDataFrame)
# how it should look:
# NumberBacteria Treatment
# 1            987     No_UV
# 2            988     No_UV
# 3            799     No_UV
# 4            233  UV_5mins
# 5            121  UV_5mins
# 6            141  UV_5mins

# do anova and store results in result.aov
result.aov = aov(NumberBacteria ~ Treatment, data = MyDataFrame)
# Summary of the analysis
summary(resAc.aov)
# is  p value significant (<0.01)?
# if so do Tukey post hoc test to see between which
# pairs of your data the sig differences are.

TukeyHSD(result.aov)
# output should show significant diff between counts
# in UV_5mins vs No_UV treatments 

# if your data are not normally distributed, it is better to do a Kruskal Wallis 
# For non-normal data (Shapiro p < 0.05) a Kruskal-Wallis followed by a post-hoc Dunn test was performed
